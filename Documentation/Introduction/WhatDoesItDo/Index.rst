What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Displays a set of pictures, each with a title, a hyperlink and as many
descriptions (RTE based) as you like. It's possible to define multiple
galleries with TypoScript and HTML Templates. These gallery types
could be easily changed with a selectbox within the Plugin element.

This extension was written to speed up development of different kinds
of Java-Script driven galleries, slideshows or interactive teasers.
